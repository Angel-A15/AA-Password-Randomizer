# Password Randomizer

## Purpose
Client requests if I can generate a random password generator to establish a higher security for
their sensitive data.

When the password generating button is clicked, the client wants to greeted with the criteria:

* A series of prompts that directs them through steps to generate a password; their
input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

* Choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters 

* Confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

* the password generated is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Description
The client will now have a stronger password to secure their information with the updates I added 
such as:

*Giving the option to add/remove specific characters for the password
by a series of window prompts

*Decide on the limit of characters the user wants generated; from a min of 8 and max of 128 characters

*The password generated will be displayed for the user to view, copy, and able to generate a new 
one.
